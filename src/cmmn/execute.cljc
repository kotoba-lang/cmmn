  "A pure, sentry-driven interpreter for a CMMN-as-EDN case model. State is plain
  data — inspectable, replayable, testable offline with fixture ports.

  A case starts with `start`; external events are applied with `raise`. After each
  `raise`, sentries are re-evaluated to a fixpoint, automatically activating items
  whose entry-criteria are all satisfied. Milestones auto-complete on activation
  (:active is immediately promoted to :completed, signifying occurrence). Done when
  all plan-items have reached a terminal state (:completed or :terminated)."
